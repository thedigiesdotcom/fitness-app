# Fitness App for Software Development Bootcamp

This project contains a Fitness App where users can book fitness classes and check out info about their trainers
Here are the Bootcamp instructions: 

Example Guide: Designing a Fitness Centre Mobile App
Step 1: Develop a Logical Structure
- Main Features: 
  - Class Schedule
  - Booking System
  - Trainer Profiles
  - User Account
- Navigation: 
  - Side menu for accessing main features and settings

Step 2: Implement Good Coding Practices
- Code Structure: 
  - Use of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for better data binding and separation of concerns
- Testing: 
  - Integration tests to ensure the booking system and class schedule sync properly
- Documentation: 
  - README file detailing how to set up the development environment and how the app functions

Step 3: Incorporate End-User Context
- User Personas: 
  - Fitness Enthusiast: Wants to book multiple classes easily
  - Casual Visitor: Interested in trying out different trainers
- User Feedback Incorporation: 
  - A 'Rate Your Class' feature to collect feedback on trainers and class quality
- Accessibility: 
  - Colour contrast and text-to-speech features for users with visual or hearing impairments

This example guide aims to help learners understand how to:
1. Develop a logical structure for the application by outlining its main features and navigation.
2. Implement good coding practices, such as using the MVVM architecture, integration testing, and thorough documentation.
3. Incorporate end-user context by identifying key user personas, creating features for user feedback, and ensuring accessibility.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo
