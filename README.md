This project contains a Fitness App where users can book fitness classes and check out info about their trainers

## Designing a Fitness Centre Mobile App

### Develop a Logical Structure
#### Main Features: 
  - Class Schedule
  - Booking System
  - Trainer Profiles
  - User Account
#### Navigation: 
  - Side menu for accessing main features and settings

### Implement Good Coding Practices
#### Code Structure: 
  - Use of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for better data binding and separation of concerns
#### Testing: 
  - Integration tests to ensure the booking system and class schedule sync properly
#### Documentation: 
  - README file detailing how to set up the development environment and how the app functions

### Incorporate End-User Context
#### User Personas: 
  - Fitness Enthusiast: Wants to book multiple classes easily
  - Casual Visitor: Interested in trying out different trainers
#### User Feedback Incorporation: 
  - A 'Rate Your Class' feature to collect feedback on trainers and class quality
#### Accessibility: 
  - Colour contrast and text-to-speech features for users with visual or hearing impairments

### This example guide aims to help learners understand how to:
1. Develop a logical structure for the application by outlining its main features and navigation.
2. Implement good coding practices, such as using the MVVM architecture, integration testing, and thorough documentation.
3. Incorporate end-user context by identifying key user personas, creating features for user feedback, and ensuring accessibility.
